v0.1
THIS LOOP DOCUMENT ISN'T IMPLEMENTED TO THE LANGUAGE YET

while loops:
@while (statement)
@endw

examples:
@while (AGC_REG_AX < 5) // note that AGC will replace AGC_REG_AX with the register "rax" if it's a x64 linux or "eax" if it's a x86 linux
    printf("hello world inside loop!\n")
@endw

@while (1) // 1 or bigger than one will become a inf loop
@endw

@while (0) // 0 won't make a loop execute
@endw

v0.2
looks pretty empty...
